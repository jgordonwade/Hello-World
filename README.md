# Hello-World
To git me goin' with Git! 

## Why I'm doing this
I've been in academia for number of years, and so my knowledge of how the software development world works is a bit out of date. I'm glad to be back, and I'm hungry to learn!

## What I plan to gain
### Position myself to be part of a software team.
   Experiment with the layout 

### Put my 2D matlab stuff here.

# What about "Propose changes"?
